This repository contains the work completed by my partner and I during the completion of our final project for CMSC508 - Database theory.

The requirements for this project were to create a database based on a topic of our choosing, we choose to convert the sport of climbing into such a database. Furthermore, we were required to create a frontend view of said database that showed at least 20 possible queries. 

My partner and I went above and beyond for this project in order to have a result we could be proud of. Utilizing HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, and MySQL we were able to create a fully functional front end for the database. 

The front end allows for account creation with admin / default accounts, different pages with queries that utilize multiple tables, and was built with modularity in mind and is expandable. It is the result of teamwork, hard work, and determination. Prior to the start of this project neither of us had experience with any of the languages we used.
