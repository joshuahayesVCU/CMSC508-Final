            <h1> What is the purpose of Climb DB? </h1>
            <p> The world of climbing is a complex and confusing place, with lots of varied equipment
                and knowledge required to correctly perform the sport. Due to the innate complexity of climbing,
                only a database can help solve the problems we typically encounter.</p>

            <p> An example of a frequent problem you may encounter
                as a climber is gear preparation. When travelling to a climbing hotspot, better known as a ‘crag’, having knowledge
                of what gear you need to bring for whichever type of climbing is critical for your success. Unfortunately,
                I only have so much gear, and information on these climbing locations isn’t necessarily fruitful.
                This is where this database will come in handy. </p>

                <p> Let’s say you, the climber knows valuable
                information pertaining to your climbing: the gear you own, your fitness levels, the crags near you, etc.
                    This web app allows you to store these aspects of climbing that pertain to you alone
                and provide a map of assistance and recommendations for your climbing enjoyment and success. </p>

            <h1> How do I use this database? </h1>

                an account, you may now store your information in the could. </p>
            <p> Think of the <b>'Gear'</b> tab as your closet. Here you can determine how much gear you own at a glance, and quickly
                update the information as you buy new gear and put aside old. </p>
            <p> The <b>'Climbs'</b> tab allows you to find nearby and far away climbs. Using information about crags and climbs from gathered
                from various sources, you're sure to find a climb you want to do. </p>
            <p> The <b>'Fitness'</b> tab allows you to keep track of your fitness levels as you progress through the sport. It's important
                to track progress so you can set and reach goals, see where you've come from, and brag to your friends. After adding your information
                into the database, you will be presented with a calculated fitness level to help find the best climbs to get stronger, faster. </p>
